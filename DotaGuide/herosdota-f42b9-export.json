Thunder Clap deals a lot of damage to nearby enemies while slowing them significantly, giving the Brewmaster time to bash their skulls in with his drunken brawling skills. If an enemy seems too dangerous the Brewmaster douses them with Drunken Haze, which causes the majority of the target`s physical attacks to miss their mark. Heroes who rely on physical attacks will find the Brewmaster nearly impossible to damage when he uses Drunken Haze and Drunken Brawler. In addition, even if the Brewmaster does seem to be in danger, he can split into three powerful elemental aspects with Primal Split. Each individual elemental panda is a dangerous fighter with their own unique abilities. The Brewmaster is a difficult enemy to defeat, and should be engaged only with overwhelming force.", "Story:Mangix originates from a deeply hidden and secret society located on the obscure island of Pandaria.

His immense strength allows him to grab the closest enemy and toss them through the air towards a target unit. Combining this with Tiny`s Avalanche spell gives him incredible area of effect damage. However, Tiny is also extremely dangerous in one on one situations. With proper timing Tiny can Toss an enemy who is taking damage from Avalanche, and if the target lands back in the Avalanche they will take double damage. This is often enough to instantly kill more fragile heroes, although tougher heroes should be wary of engaging the Stone Giant as well. Tiny`s Craggy Exterior can occasionally stun close range attackers, giving him time to escape or punish them with his crushing blows. If possible, it`s best to keep this mobile mountain at arm`s length.", "Story:Looming from the rocky crags of Ashenra, the stone giants are born from the mountain itself.

With a great understanding of the spiritual realm, he becomes more resilient against magical attacks using his Spell Shield, along with the ability to Blink across short distances for superb maneuverability. Seeking out weary casters, he uses Mana Void to inflict immense damage for high amounts of missing mana.

Magina`s eventual overexposure to the magics gradually augmented his elemental resistances and bestowed him the unique ability to move faster than light itself. Now, broken by Terrorblade`s fall to the dark side, Magina answers the Sentinel`s call in a desperate bid to redeem his brother.

Most of the Chieftain`s abilities revolve around the guardian spirit which aids him in battle. Using Ancestral Spirit, Cairne can temporarily separate the guardian spirit from himself. While the spirit is separate, it causes damage to enemies it strikes and mimics the Chieftain`s movement and Echo Stomp ability. When the spirit and Cairne rejoin, he gains a boost to his physical damage and move speed, the strength of which depends on how many enemies the spirit collided with. This makes him a very dangerous physical attacker, especially combined with his offensive aura, Natural Order. This ability reduces the base armor and magic resistance of all nearby units, giving the Chieftain`s attacks and spells a significant boost to their damage. His final ability is called Earth Splitter, a powerful area of effect spell which can cause severe damage and disable many enemies at once. Since it takes a few seconds to have any effect and is easy to dodge on its own, it`s best to combo this ability with either Echo Stomp or allied disabling spells. However, if multiple enemy heroes are hit by this ability, it generally spells their doom.", "Story:Since ancient times it has been prophesized by the Tauren elders that a Chieftain will come, strong as the mightiest warriors and wise as the eldest shamans. After many years of wandering the sacred lands, seeking wisdom from his forefathers, Cairne Bloodhoof has proven himself as the long awaited hero. Cairne carries with him the spirit of his mightiest ancestor, and now the ground shakes with the combined strength of the Chieftain and his guardian spirit. No physical nor magical barrier can reduce the power of his enchanted halberd, the weapon used by his guardian in ancient times. Such is the power of this axe that it can split the very earth itself. Seeking revenge for the ravaging of his homeland, Cairne will soon bring his wrath upon the Scourge." ],

Enemies of the Bristleback will soon find themselves covered in goo and shredded by constant quill fire if they aren`t careful. Quill Spray deals increasing damage with each cast on the same target, and due to its low cooldown and mana cost it can be very deadly over time. When Rigwarl sees that his enemies are sufficiently weakened, he can move in for the kill with Viscous Nasal Goo. This ability slows the target and reduces their armor, increasing the damage of Quill Spray and Bristleback`s physical attack and making it impossible to escape. Furthermore, casting spells puts Bristleback on the Warpath, which increases his movement and attack speeds as he uses his abilities. Bristleback`s signature skill, and where he gets his name, is his near invulnerability to attacks that strike his back.

His Meat Hook skill is extremely deadly, but also difficult to utilize. A well placed Meat Hook will snag an enemy hero and drag them to the Butcher, dealing a lot of damage along the way. Once the target has been hooked, Pudge uses his other two active skills to finish them off. Rot is a toggled damage over time skill which affects all nearby enemies and also Pudge himself. Pudge must be careful when using this skill. Although it does a lot of damage it can quickly drain his life and make him easy prey for enemies. To stop his target from escaping or fighting back, Pudge can use his Dismember ability. This short range skill deals even more damage and completely immobilizes the target. When used in succession, these three skills make Pudge a dangerous assassin, although he may not look like it. To aid his risky gameplay, Pudge has a passive skill called Flesh Heap. Flesh Heap provides some magic resistance which reduces the damage he takes from rot, and gives him a minor permanent bonus to his strength every time he kills a unit.", "Story:An undead behemoth seemingly impervious to even the most potent magic, this starving abomination roams the battlefield, continually in search of unwary prey. It is said his victims catch only a glimpse of his monstrous frame as they are dragged them through the shadows, bleeding profusely as a jagged hook etches deeper in their flesh. Wails of agony echo in the distance, only to be drowned out by the Butcher's maniacal laughter as he severs their limp bodies with his great maw. Unspeakable horrors ensue in a deathly silence, a dreadful omen for what is to come." ],

He excels at chasing down fragile heroes and bashing them into the dirt. Slithereen Crush and Bash allow him to stun and damage a target, then follow up with additional bashes to keep them stunned and finish them off. To get into close enough range to make use of his stun skills, Slardar uses Sprint. Sprint gives him a massive movement speed bonus for a relatively long duration, but causes him to take extra damage from enemy attacks and spells. This downside makes good Sprint usage critical for Slardar: trying to catch a fleeing hero with Sprint can often turn into a trap, and due to the extra damage Slardar can get into a lot of trouble. To help keep an eye on his target and make sure they go down quickly, Slardar uses Amplify Damage. This ability gives him vision of a target unit and drastically reduces their armor, making them easy prey for his powerful attacks. If faced with this dangerous hero, it's best to keep him as far away as possible.", "Story:After a millennium of being trapped under the raging waters of the Maelstrom, Slardar rose from its chaotic depths with his brethren to serve the mighty demon lord, Illidan Stormrage. Fanatically devoted to his cause, this Naga fought valiantly along his side until he succumbed to fatal wounds in the heat of battle. Salvation finally seemed within grasp - that is until his fate became intertwined with the grim reach of the Lich King. Reincarnated as a soulless beast without emotion, Slardar tears through the enemy lines with inhuman speed, striking them out cold with mighty blows, undeterred in his quest to fulfill Ner'zhul's every whim." ],

Using his Gush skill, he can slow and damage a single target while reducing their armor, allow the Tidehunter and his allies to pummel the target to a pulp. To aid his close combat skills, the Leviathan has a powerful Anchor Smash passive skill, which gives him a chance to unleash a devastating area of effect spin with every attack. A target of Gush who is hit by an Anchor Smash or two is in deep trouble. To protect himself while chasing down and smashing enemies, Leviathan has a second passive: Kraken Shell. This ability reduces all damage from physical attacks by a set number, allowing the Leviathan to wade into combat without fear, ignoring the blows of lesser foes. Kraken Shell also occasionally dispels negative spell effects from Leviathan, making him even more difficult to stop. By far the most feared ability of the Tidehunter is Ravage. This mighty ability allows the Tidehunter to cause immense damage and stun all enemies in a large area around him. This ability is most effective in large team battles, where it is a simple matter to hit the entire enemy team at once with its spikes, setting up the Tidehunter and his allies for an easy victory.", "Story:Formerly considered by the Old Gods as an oeuvre of the cosmos, Leviathan was thrown into the watery abyss after an alleged connivance with the Titans whom they have fought against. Chained to an anchor and guarded by a virtually indomitable kraken, the Tidehunter had lain dormant in the unfathomable depths for eons until he finally mustered enough strength to break away. He killed his enslaver, took its shell as armor and the once loathed anchor became his weapon. Unforgiving and frigid as the sea, Leviathan had sworn to disembowel everyone who would dare disturb his much valued freedom as he knocks them out with ravaging force.

With proper placement, a single Reverse Polarity can change the outcome of a team battle and potentially win the game. If combined with other area of effect spells, Reverse Polarity can destroy an entire enemy team. However, Magnus himself is no pushover in combat. Using Empower and Mighty Swing in conjunction gives him a very strong physical attack capable of damaging multiple bunched up units, perfect when used after Reverse Polarity. In addition, Magnus has an area of effect spell of his own: Shockwave. Due to its relatively low mana cost and cooldown coupled with its high damage, Shockwave is an effective tool for harassing enemies in a lane and finishing off damaged foes. Although the power of Reverse Polarity tends to overshadow his other skills, Magnus is far from a one-skill hero.", "Story:Maybe the most tremendous being on the Scourge, Magnus is a power to be reckoned with. Trained from birth to become a potent warrior, he is now at the peak of his strength. The Magnataur's giant axe can cleave paths through his enemies, and create a bone-breaking shockwave that ripples through the ground. Further strengthened by a demonic magic that enhances his attacks, he can crush enemies with shocking ease.

His skills are focused on disabling and killing a single enemy hero, making him much more effective in ambushes and one on one situations than large team battles. The Spiritbreaker generally opens with a Charge of Darkness, which allows him to charge from any point on the map towards the target, increasing in speed as he approaches his target. Upon arrival, he delivers a crushing stun, giving him time to follow up with his other active ability: Netherstrike. Netherstrike is a short range teleporting attack, which knocks the target back and deals massive damage. The Spiritbreaker's two passive skills supplement this combo. Empowering Haste is a aura which significantly boosts the movement speed of the Spiritbreaker and nearby allies, as well as providing him with a damage bonus based on his movement speed. Greater Bash is partly what makes the Spiritbreaker so feared by lone enemies.

Although he is unable to move while remaining invisible, nearby enemies will take damage as long as they remain in the storm. The Sand King can finish off groups off units with his Caustic Finale passive skill, which causes a deadly explosion every time he kills a unit with his physical attack.

Waning Rift deals damage and silences in an area around Puck, making it the natural choice for use after an Illusory Orb and Ethereal Jaunt. Puck`s final offensive spell, Dream Coil, can be used either before or after this combo with great effect. Dream Coil traps enemies in a small area, forcing them to remain near the target point or take damage and get stunned. To complement his need to get up into his target`s face, Puck has Phase Shift to help in sticky situations. Phase Shift renders Puck invulnerable for several seconds, although he is unable to move in this state. Puck is a relatively easy hero to pick up, but a rewarding one to master.", "Story:In Sentinel`s search for heroes to aid them in the war against the Scourge, they discovered the lost lands of the mystical Faerie Dragons. Upon explaining the conflict to the Faerie Queen of Agrace, she sent forth Puck, a personal guardian, to turn the tides of war. Despite his small size and mischievous personality, the little dragon soon proved to pack more than his fair share of power on the battlefield, blasting through the enemy ranks with balls of magic, faerie dust, and the capability to stupefy an entire army with nothing more than his imagination. His foes all learned the hard way that size matters not in combat, and that appearances are, ultimately, deceiving." ],

His spell damage output is probably the highest of any hero in the game, due to the great damage and low cooldown periods of his spells. Arc Lightning strikes a large number of enemies with a relatively low damage chain lightning, but due to its low cost and cooldown it can be cast a large number of times during a battle. Lightning Bolt is easy to understand: lots of damage! Compared to a lot of other offensive spells, Lightning Bolt`s damage, cooldown, and mana cost are very good, and it is Zeus` primary means for dealing with enemy heroes. Although Zeus has a passive skill, it is in fact another way to blast his enemies with even more spell damage. Every time Zeus casts a spell, Static Field shocks nearby enemy heroes for a small percentage of their life. This means Zeus will continue to deal good damage throughout the game as enemy heroes get higher and higher life. Perhaps Zeus` most feared ability is Thundergod`s Wrath. When cast, this spell causes a bolt of lightning to strike all enemy heroes on the battlefield. This spell is especially useful for finishing off nearly dead heroes who are fleeing from battle, but it is also useful to give Zeus and his allies an edge in team fights.", "Story:Once a deity of unfathomable might, Zeus reluctantly sacrificed his much relished immortality in exchange for the chance to crush the sinister armies of the unholy undead. As his soul crossed into the mortal plane, his omnipotent powers withered greatly, yet not nearly enough to quell this destructive Thunder God`s resolve for justice. With sheer precision, he cleanses through the enemy ranks with an impressive mastery of electrical discharge, smiting the fool hardy with formidable bolts of lightning from the heavens above.

Using Teleportation, he can quickly be anywhere on the battlefield practically at will. A Prophet with good map awareness can be an invaluable help to his allies, since he can potentially be in any battle anywhere on the map. Using Sprout, he can trap enemy heroes and finish them off with his strong physical attack and allied help. After dealing with any resistance, he can summon an army of Treants and quickly destroy enemy towers and buildings before they have a chance to retaliate.

Although Curse of the Silent deals surprisingly good damage to unprepared opponents, the Silencer`s real power lies in his Glaives of Wisdom. With powerful intelligence items, the Silencer is capable of easily out-damaging many strength and agility heroes who focus on their physical attacks. Since he needs powerful items to be effective, the Silencer is best utilized by players who enjoy killing a lot of creeps and getting as much gold as possible. Both of his silencing abilities are very useful in combat, especially against enemy spellcasters who like to cast a lot of spells in quick succession. Last Word is an offensive aura which silences enemies after they cast a spell. This will completely ruin the deadly combos of a lot of dangerous spellcasters, making the Silencer an excellent counter to this type of enemy.

Her two main offensive spells provide a powerful area of effect combo. Dragon Slave fires a quick fiery projectile which deals good damage and has pretty high range. Light Strike Array is Lina`s stun spell. Due to her relatively slow cast time it can be difficult to hit moving enemies with this spell, however. Many Lina players cast Light Strike Array right after an ally uses another stun, making the spell much easier to hit and prolonging the total disable time. To support her offensive gameplay style, Lina has a passive skill called Fiery Soul. Every time she casts any of her other spells, Lina gains a temporary movement and attack speed bost, allowing her to chase down and kill fleeing enemies. Lina also has the most damaging single-target spell in the game: Laguna Blade. This devastating blast of energy is one of the best ways to finish off injured enemies. Often heroes who thought they were safe are blasted into oblivion by a single Laguna Blade.", "Story:A renowned pyromancer roaming the lands, Lina Inverse originally joined the Sentinel for monetary purposes.

When equipped with a lot of items, the Storm Spirit can be seen bouncing around the battlefield, zapping his foes and quickly jumping away. Raijin relies partly on his physical attack and partly on his spells to defeat his enemies. Static Remnant is his main source of spell damage. When cast, this ability leaves a staticky copy of the Storm Spirit behind. Similar to a landmine the image will explode on contact, shocking all nearby enemies. Electric Vortex is a very powerful disabling spell, which grabs a target enemy and drags them to the Storm Spirit. A common tactic is to use Electric Vortex to pull a target into a Static Remnant image. Overload completes this combo, giving the Storm Spirit`s next attack a blast of electrical energy whenever he casts a spell. However, Raijin`s signature ability is definitely Ball Lightning. This teleportation spell has no cooldown and no maximum range, which means Raijin can bounce about as much as he wants, as long as he has the mana and regeneration to support the high cost of the spell.

She relies on her physical attack most of the time, and she has a powerful attack speed increasing ability which lets her fire very quickly. She can launch deadly Power Shots, which strike the first target with massive damage, then lose a little the more units they pass through. Power Shot is very good at picking off injured heroes who are trying to flee, due to its long range, fast projectile, and good initial damage. To stop enemies from fleeing in the first place, Alleria has Shackleshot. Although it doesn`t deal any damage by itself, Shackleshot is one of the best single-target stuns around. This ability allows the Windrunner to shackle a target either to a tree or to another enemy unit, potentially stunning two heroes for a lengthy period of time. Windrunner, Alleria`s third skill, allows her to escape dangerous situations, position herself for good Shackleshots, and catch up to fleeing enemies. If Powershot isn`t enough to take down a target, Alleria can use Focus Fire. This powerful ability makes her attack at the fastest possible rate at a single enemy unit for a long duration, but reduces her total damage. This skill is often used in conjunction with Shackleshot, but it is also effective against buildings and other stationary targets.", "Story:In the valleys of Winterspring, deep within the verdant glades of the Forest of Trees, an elf with the power of the wind makes her home.

Her arrows fly straight and true, piercing all enemies in a line. She can lace her arrow with wind and bind enemies together by creating ethereal shackles. Her footsteps are hastened by the currents of air. It is known that she can dispatch enemies at blinding speed by releasing a flurry of arrows. She is indeed a worthy enemy of the Scourge." ],

His array of very different offensive spells give him the ability to deal a lot of damage in any situation, which makes him a strong laner, but also a potential carry. Rocket Barrage, his first skill, shoots rockets at random targets around Gyrocopter, which makes it an exceptionally strong ability against lone enemies. With the low cooldown, short duration but high attack frequency it can easily decimate an enemy`s HP in the early stage of the game... if you manage to stay in range. The Homing Missile is his second ability. It creates a missile that chases an enemy until it hits him or is destroyed, dealing more damage the further it flies. While less powerful in a stationary fight, this ability is a mighty asset in chases and on the lane. With the stun it works well with Rocket Barrage and Calldown. Flak Cannons is an ability based on attacks, enabling Gyrocopter to attack all enemies in a certain area around him at once for a few attacks. Since the amount of targets is not limited, this ability is effective for farming and countering strong pushes. A Gyrocopter with a good selection offensive items standing amidst a group of enemy heroes can deal a devastating amount of damage with Flak Cannons, but that also makes him the main target of his enemies. Last but not least, his ultimate is Calldown. Gyrocopter shoots two rockets into the skies which come down in the targeted area one after another, dealing damage and slowing the enemies. While it is relatively difficult to hit, a well-placed Calldown can easily decide a fight with the powerful AoE slow and the synergy with his other abilities. With Aghanim`s Scepter, the range gets upgraded from 1000 to global. This is not only useful to finish off enemies who barely escaped a fight, but can also be used to push, defend and farm on any lane while Gyrocopter is somewhere else. Gyrocopter can deal vast amounts of damage in any stage of the game and in any situation, but his lack of defensive abilities also make him easy to bring down.", "Story:Raised amongst the dwarven mining clan, Aurel grew up with a fascination for making things explode.

When he finds a strong creep or two, he descends on his unwary enemies, using both his own spells and the abilities of his persuaded creeps to take them out. Due to the difficulty of effectively controlling multiple units and abilities, Chen can be a tricky hero to play to his full potential. When ambushing an enemy hero, Chen generally uses his Penitence ability, which slows the target and causes them to take extra damage from Chen and his allies. The Holy Knight can use Test of Faith to finish off enemies, but it also doubles as a way to save allies who are in danger. Casting Test of Faith on an ally will teleport them to safety after a short time.

He has three spells which target an area of effect in front of him, and getting caught in his barrage can cause a lot of pain. Dual Breath is his primary ability, burning and freezing all enemies in a large cone in front of him. In addition to the slow from Dual Breath, he can also completely disable multiple enemies with Ice Path. With two movement disable spells, Jakiro is a good supporter for his allies. In addition, Liquid Fire makes him effective at reducing the effectiveness of enemy physical attack heroes, as well as making towers easier to attack by slowing their retaliation. Macropyre can do a lot of damage if the enemy stays in its path, but it is often more effective as a deterrent rather than a source of damage.

Voodoo is a straightforward polymorph skill, transforming the target into a critter and knocking them out of the fight for a few seconds. Shackles is an interesting ability which disables both the target and Rhasta while he channels the spell. However, this is not much of a disadvantage to Rhasta, since his Mass Serpent Ward ability gives him a deadly source of alternate damage to destroy his target while he holds them in place.

Although his primary attack spell, Impale, deals relatively low damage, it has a long stun at high levels and can hit multiple targets quite easily. The low spell damage of Impale is more than compensated for by Lion`s lethal Finger of Death ability, which deals very high damage to a single enemy target. Finger of Death is an excellent finishing spell for injured enemies. Although Impale alone is a good disabling spell, the Demon Witch has a second strong disable: Voodoo. Voodoo can transform an enemy hero into a critter for a few seconds, allowing Lion and his allies time to finish them off. Lion`s spells all cost quite a bit of mana, but he can quickly regain it using Mana Drain. This spell is effective for draining an enemy hero`s mana while they are disabled or giving Lion a quick mana boost from an enemy Necromancer or Druid of the Talon creep.

With good summoning and disabling spells, the Enigma is also a great support hero. Malefice is a unique stun, which hits a target several times over a few seconds instead of all at once. This makes it great for chasing down enemy heroes and preventing foes who rely on channeling abilities from casting their spells. To aid his damage output, the Enigma relies on his Conversion spell, which transforms a target creep into three Eidolons which multiply as they attack. This spell can even be cast on powerful neutral creeps, making the Enigma a good neutral creeper and ambusher. The real power of the Enigma is his Black Hole, however. Black Hole is a very powerful channeling spell which completely disables all enemies in a large area around the target location for a good length of time. In addition, it drags them together, providing a perfect target for the spells of the Enigma`s allies. To further increase the power of this already deadly spell, the Enigma uses Midnight Pulse, an area of effect spell which causes repeated damage based on the target`s maximum life. Although powerful alone, the Enigma is strongest when supported by allies with strong area of effect spells, since they can make the best use of his Black Hole.", "Story:The result of a collapsed star entombed within a field of elemental magic, Darchrow is one of the most dangerous beings in existence, consuming hundreds of worlds into the void of his hate and hunger.

Repeatedly casting Frost Nova and harassing with physical attacks is a surefire way to quickly bring an enemy hero to his knees. However, Frost Nova becomes even more dangerous when coupled with Dark Ritual. This spell allows the Lich to destroy an allied creep and gain mana based on its life. Using this spell helps the Lich by giving him limitless mana for Frost Nova, and hinders his enemies by denying them any experience or gold they would have gained from the destroyed creep. By using Frost Nova and Dark Ritual liberally, the Lich can quickly force any opponent to retreat from his lane.

However, this doesn`t stop him from being one of the strongest offensive spellcasters around. The Necrolyte`s Death Pulse is his bread and butter. This powerful ability doubles as a damage spell and a healing spell, with both effects on every cast. Death Pulse hits all nearby enemies causing damage, and also hits all nearby allies and the Necrolyte which heals them. Since it has a short cooldown period, this spell can be cast very often, providing constant damage to enemies and health to allies and allowing the Necrolyte to plenty of creep kills. To fuel this barrage, the Necrolyte has a passive skill called Sadist which replenishes some of his mana every time he kills a unit. To further weaken his enemies, his powerful Hearstopper Aura slow drains the life of all foes in a large area of effect around the Necrolyte. When he sees a sufficiently injured enemy hero, the Necrolyte uses Reaper`s Scythe, which is possibly the best spell in the game for killing off damaged heroes. This deadly spell deals damage based on how much life the target is missing, so even the toughest heroes die just as a fast as the fragile ones.

Due to his massive base intelligence and high gain per level, he has plenty of mana to cast his spells as much as he wants. Nether Blast is his primary method for dealing damage, and its large area of effect, high strength, and low cooldown make it good for harassing enemy heroes and killing creeps. In addition, Nether Blast also deals damage to towers, which makes Pugna a powerful sieging hero with Nether Blast alone. Pugna`s Decrepify spell is useful in several ways. It functions as a decent movement speed slowing spell for catching fleeing enemies, and also amplifies spell damage against the target. Decrepify and Nether Blast make a powerful combination. Decrepify can also be cast on allies, and since it prevents the target from being hit by physical attacks, it gives clever Pugna players a way to deal with potentially troublesome physical attack oriented heroes by either Decrepifying the enemy hero (which prevents them from attacking), or an allied hero to prevent them from being attacked. Decrepified enemies can still cast spells, but with Pugna`s Nether Ward placed they will be struck by bolts of lightning whenever they use a skill. Finally, Pugna`s natural fragility is somewhat mediated by his Life Drain spell, which rapidly heals Pugna while dealing a lot of damage to his target. Pugna is especially effective at shutting down enemy spellcasters with his Nether Ward, but his versatility makes him good in any situation.", "Story:Forcefully raised from the dead with little memory of his former self, Pugna is truly a terrible sight to behold. Retaining traces of necromantic magic, this shamble of bones finds sadistic pleasure in temporarily sending his enemies into a tormented dimension and greeting their return with a blast of unholy energy.

His deadly Arcane Orb enhances his attacks with large amounts of unresistable pure damage, and if his mana pool gets high enough the Obsidian Destroyer is capable of killing fragile enemies with only a few Arcane Orb attacks. Astral Prison is a useful ability, which can put a powerful enemy hero out of the fight or save an ally from death. In addition, it drains intelligence when cast on an enemy hero, and by repeatedly using this ability the Obsidian Destroyer can quickly reduce the enemies` mana pool, making it difficult for them to cast many spells. To keep both his own and his allies` mana pools full, the Obsidian Destroyer has a passive skill called Essence Aura. In addition to boosting the Destroyer`s own mana pool, this aura gives any allied unit under its effect a chance to instantly regain a portion of their total mana pool every time they cast a spell. Essence Aura fuels Arcane Orb, giving the Destroyer potent damage with little risk of running dry. Although Arcane Orb and Astral Prison make the Destroyer deadly in small engagements, his powerful Sanity`s Eclipse spell can turn the tide of large battles. An Obsidian Destroyer with a lot of intelligence items can kill or badly wound several enemy heroes at once with this spell. Few heroes are capable of putting out as much damage as a pumped up Obsidian Destroyer.", "Story:An obsidian construct brought to life through the ill conceived necromancy of the Lich King, Harbinger craves magic to make up for the emptiness brought on by the incomplete nature of its summoning.

Thanks to this versatility, the Warlock can often be found supporting allies against difficult enemies, using his Shadow Word to heal his lane partner or harass an enemy hero. Later in the game the Warlock`s other spells come into play. Fatal Bonds links enemy units together, causing them all to take extra damage when one is attacked.

Before moving in for the kill, the Batrider tends to soften up his target with Sticky Napalm, a stacking debuff skill which slows movement speed and turn rate. When he is ready to make his move, the Batrider uses his explosive Flamebreak spell, which strikes the first enemy unit it hits, exploding and knocking back nearby units. When his enemies are sufficiently demoralized, the Batrider swoops in using his Firefly ability and grabs a target hero with Flaming Lasso. This ability allows the Batrider to drag a target hero behind him, pulling the hapless victim away from the safety of his allies and in to the waiting clutches of his enemies. Although he may seem like a support hero, the Batrider is capable of dealing enormous damage with Sticky Napalm, Flamebreak, Firely, and his regular attack, due to the stacking damage provided by Sticky Napalm. It`s best to be wary when faced against this hero, as his seemingly suicidal attacks can turn out a lot more dangerous than they appear.", "Story:Once an expendable spy, Jin`zakk has outlived the suicidal tendencies of other Bat Riders to create a unique style, one that favours control and precision instead of wanton destruction. His years of battle experience have allowed him to innovate creative uses for his fiery arts: He can douse enemies in a bath of sticky oil that restricts their movements before igniting it, fire an explosive that blows enemies away, or take flight to leave behind a trail of flame. However, his most deadly skill involves lassoing his opponent and dragging the unfortunate foe into the arms of his allies." ],

Hence, he is extremely effective backing up allies with strong physical attacks. Poison Touch doesn`t deal much damage, but it is a very effective slow and stun with a ridiculously short cooldown. Escaping from a Shadow Priest with a high level Poison Touch is nearly impossible. Shadow Wave doubles as a good heal and damage ability. Similar to Poison Touch, this ability may seem weak at first, but due to the extremely low cooldown it can be cast constantly, and with some clever placement can cause a lot of damage. Shallow Grave is an essential ability. When cast on a nearly dead ally, it can prolong life for several crucial seconds, allowing them to escape or cause even more damage before they go down. Often enemies will chase a hero who is under the effect of this spell, believing them to be an easy kill. This is can be a fatal mistake. Finally, the Weave spell gives the Shadow Priest a method for boosting the power of his own spells and also giving his team a significant advantage in any battle. Due to the low cost and cooldown of Weave, Dazzle can cast it at practically every fight with great effect.", "Story:Little is known to the Shadowtooth Clan, likely because this group of shadowy trolls never unveil the secrets of their mystifying sacrament.

Grave Chill provides him a potent chasing ability and powerful slow in one skill. With Soul Assumption, Visage gains strength from hovering near dying creeps. The damage bonus and healing from this skill allow him to remain indefinitely in a lane, killing creeps and harassing with his high damage attack. Combining Grave Chill and Soul Assumption makes Visage a dangerous ranged fighter. Defensively, Gravekeeper`s Cloak makes the Necro`lic very difficult to kill if he pumps up his hit points and regeneration, as it reduces all incoming damage and heals all nearby allies at the same time.

He is one of the most powerful direct damage spellcasters, and his spells can even out-damage pumped up physical attack heroes late in the game. Split Earth is an area of effect stun. Although new players will find it can be difficult to hit, it has a relatively low cooldown and is sure to cause a lot of pain if it does connect. Diabolic Edict is an extremely effective spell if used well, causing a huge amount of damage if it hits a single enemy hero for its entire duration. Since it deals physical damage, it is excellent at destroying buildings and fighting magic immune heroes. Lightning Storm is a straightforward spell, but since the cooldown period is only 6 seconds long it is one of the best harassment spells around. In addition, each bounce deals full damage, allowing clever Leshrac players to hit foes from very long range by targeting creeps and letting the lightning bounce to the intended victim. Pulse Nova is Leshrac`s final offensive spell, and can potentially deal the most damage of any of his abilities.

His Maledict ability is feared by all, and has the potential for enormous amounts of damage. Heroes under the effect of Maledict will continue to take damage based on how much damage they have taken already. Using Paralyzing Casks, a clever Witch Doctor immobilizes his target, casts Maledict on them, then proceeds to cause as much damage as possible before they run. This is nearly always fatal if the Witch Doctor and his allies can injure the target a good amount after it is Maledicted. To aid in the delayed destruction of his enemies, the Witch Doctor can plant a potent Death Ward, which rapidly attacks nearby heroes as long as the Witch Doctor channels it. Combined with Maledict and Paralyzing Cask, Death Ward is practically a guaranteed kill when ambushing an unsuspecting enemy hero. Voodoo Restoration turns him into a mobile healing fountain, quickly restoring the life of the Doctor and his allies in case an ambush doesn`t go according to plan. Although the Witch Doctor`s Maledict combo is lethal on its own, it is even more dangerous when combined with allied attacks and spells.", "Story:Vol`Jin is a risk-taker.
